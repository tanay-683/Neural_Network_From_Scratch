# Neural_Network_From_Scratch

- This repository contains the code for a simple neural network from scratch using only numpy. 
- This is a scalable neural network that can be used for any number of layers and any number of neurons in each layer.
> The ideology behind this code is that `each layer will keep track of its own as well as the previous layer's weights and biases`.
## Usage
- Go to `implement.py` file and run that file, the implementation is as same as keras.
- To see the layer's source code:

>| Layer | Source Code |
>| --- | --- |
>| Dense | [dense_layer.py](dense_layer.py) |
>| Input | [input_layer.py](input_layer.py) |
>| Model | [model.py](model.py) |
>| Batch Normalization | [batch_normalization.py](batch_normalization.py) |
